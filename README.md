# CORVID-19 Coordinate

This is a tool to help coordinate volunteers and information for people in need of it.

## development

```sh
npm i          # install tools and dependencies
npm start      # local dev-server
npm run deploy # deploy application on firebase
```

You'll need to make a file called `firebase.json` in root of project that has firebase config from [the console](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/project/covid19-coordinate/settings/general/web).
